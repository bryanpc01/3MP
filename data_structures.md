# Ruby Data Stucture Coding Problems

### Linear Data Structures
1) Array - elements of the same kind that are together in sequence.
2) Linked List - a list of nodes that has two items, the data and the refernce to the next node. (singly, doubly, circular)
* Singular - every node stores the reference to the next node. Last node stores NULL.
* Doubly - every node stores the reference to the previous and next nodes. First node looks back at NULL, Last node looks forward to NULL.
* Circular - nodes are linked to form a circle. Last node points to the first node. 
3) Stack - Last in, First out. implementation using arrays or linked list
* Push - adds an element to the top of the array.
* Pop - removes an element from the top of the array.
4) Queue - First in, First out. implementation using arrays or linked list.
* Enqueue - add an element to the queue. From the rear side.
* Dequeue - removes an element from the queue. From the front side.
